# Test of my "skeleton" code
To make things easier and more organized I made a .c and .h file which can be included in every project from now on that takes care of the setup stuff, pragma configs, etc.  
It is nearly the same as the NU32.c and NU32.h files we used with every project in ME33. I opted to name it NM32 because NM is my initials.
